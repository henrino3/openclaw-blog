I've used both for real work. Not demos. Not tutorials. Actual production workflows running for months.

Here's what the marketing pages won't tell you.

## The Quick Version

| Feature | OpenClaw | Zapier AI |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Setup Time | 20-40 min | 5-15 min |
| Customization | High | Limited |
| Learning Curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Pricing (mid-tier) | $99/mo | $73.50/mo |
| Best For | Complex agents | Simple automations |

## Where Zapier AI Wins

**Speed to first automation.** If you need a "summarize new emails and post to Slack" workflow, Zapier gets you there in 8 minutes. I've timed it.

**Integration breadth.** 6,000+ apps. OpenClaw has maybe 200 native integrations. The gap matters when you're connecting obscure tools.

**Reliability for simple flows.** Linear automations with 3-5 steps run flawlessly. Zapier's infrastructure is mature. It just works.

## Where OpenClaw Wins

**Actual agent behavior.** OpenClaw agents maintain context across interactions. They remember what happened three messages ago. Zapier AI is stateless between triggers.

**Complex decision logic.** When I needed an agent to triage support tickets using 12 different criteria with fallback paths, OpenClaw handled it. Zapier's branching got confusing after path four.

**Customization depth.** Prompt engineering, custom tools, memory configuration. OpenClaw lets you build the exact agent you want. Zapier gives you templates.

## My Frustrations

**With OpenClaw:** The onboarding assumes you've built agents before. I spent 3 hours on documentation before my first useful workflow. The learning curve is real.

**With Zapier AI:** It wants to be an "AI" product, but the AI feels bolted on. The smart features work well in isolation but don't compose into coherent agent behavior.

## Pricing Reality

Zapier's headline price looks cheaper. Then you hit the task limits.

My support triage workflow processes about 4,000 interactions per month. On Zapier, that pushes you to the $448.50/month tier. OpenClaw's $199/month plan covers it with room to spare.

For low-volume use cases, Zapier is genuinely cheaper. For anything substantial, do the math before committing.

## The Honest Recommendation

Use Zapier AI if:
- Your workflows are linear (trigger → action → done)
- You need broad app integration
- Your team isn't technical
- Volume is under 1,000 tasks/month

Use OpenClaw if:
- You need stateful, context-aware agents
- Complex decision logic is required
- You want control over prompts and behavior
- You're building something production-serious

## What I Actually Use

My Zapier runs simple notifications. New Stripe payment? Ping Slack. New calendar event? Add to my task tracker.

My OpenClaw agents do the thinking work. Support triage, lead qualification, research synthesis.

Different tools, different jobs. The mistake is expecting one to replace the other.
