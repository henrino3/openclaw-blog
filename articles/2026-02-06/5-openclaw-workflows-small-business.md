I manage operations for a 15-person marketing agency. Before OpenClaw, I spent roughly 12 hours weekly on repetitive admin tasks. Now it's under 2 hours.

Here are the five workflows that made the difference, with actual time savings from our tracking.

## 1. Client Report Assembly

**Before:** 3 hours/week
**After:** 20 minutes/week

Our clients get weekly performance reports. Previously, I pulled data from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and our project management tool, then formatted everything in Google Slides.

Now the agent:
- Pulls metrics from all three platforms via APIs
- Generates commentary on significant changes
- Creates the slide deck with our template
- Drafts the email summary

I review and send. Most weeks I change nothing.

**Setup time:** About 4 hours to configure the initial workflow and template.

## 2. Meeting Prep and Follow-Up

**Before:** 2 hours/week
**After:** 15 minutes/week

For every client meeting, I used to manually:
- Review last meeting notes
- Check recent communications
- List open action items
- Send follow-up summary

The agent now preps a one-page brief before each meeting and drafts follow-up emails from meeting transcripts. The Fireflies integration captures transcripts automatically.

I stopped losing track of promised deliverables.

**Setup time:** 2 hours, mostly configuring the meeting notes template.

## 3. Invoice Processing

**Before:** 4 hours/week
**After:** 30 minutes/week

Contractor invoices come in various formats. PDFs, emails, even photos of paper receipts.

The agent:
- Extracts invoice details regardless of format
- Matches to our project codes
- Flags anything unusual (amount differs from contract, duplicate submission)
- Queues approved invoices for payment

I review the flagged items only. Unflagged invoices process automatically.

**Setup time:** 6 hours. The PDF extraction required some iteration to handle all our vendor formats.

## 4. Social Media Scheduling

**Before:** 2 hours/week
**After:** 30 minutes/week

We post across LinkedIn, X, and Instagram for the agency and several clients.

The agent drafts posts based on:
- New blog content we publish
- Industry news it monitors
- Engagement patterns from previous posts

I review the queue once per day, approve or edit, and the scheduling happens automatically.

The posts aren't brilliant creative work, but they maintain consistent presence without my constant attention.

**Setup time:** 3 hours for initial prompt tuning to match our voice.

## 5. Email Triage and Response Drafting

**Before:** 1.5 hours/week
**After:** 15 minutes/week

My inbox was chaos. Now the agent:
- Labels emails by urgency and category
- Drafts responses for routine requests
- Summarizes long threads
- Surfaces messages that need my direct attention

I handle the important stuff. The agent handles the "confirmed, thanks" replies.

**Setup time:** 1 hour. This was the easiest to configure.

## Total Impact

| Workflow | Before | After | Saved |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Client reports | 3h | 20m | 2h 40m |
| Meeting prep | 2h | 15m | 1h 45m |
| Invoices | 4h | 30m | 3h 30m |
| Social media | 2h | 30m | 1h 30m |
| Email | 1.5h | 15m | 1h 15m |
| **Total** | **12.5h** | **1h 50m** | **10h 40m** |

## What Didn't Work

Client communication beyond simple follow-ups still needs a human. The agent drafted a response to a frustrated client once that was technically accurate but completely wrong in tone. Learned that lesson the hard way.

Also, anything requiring judgment about priorities. The agent can surface options but shouldn't decide which client gets prioritized when we're overloaded.

## Getting Started

If you're new to OpenClaw, start with email triage. It's the fastest to set up and the benefits are immediate. Save the complex workflows for after you understand how the agent thinks.
