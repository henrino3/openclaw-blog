The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund dropped 20% in four weeks. HubSpot is down 39% year-to-date. Salesforce shed $80 billion in market cap. All because an AI assistant can now summarize documents and draft contracts.

I've spent the last 72 hours reading analyst notes, SEC filings, and earnings calls. The consensus view is that Anthropic's Cowork represents an existential threat to vertical SaaS. The consensus view is wrong.

## Understanding What Cowork Actually Does

Before we can assess the threat, we need precision about the capability.

Cowork is an agentic interface to Claude Opus. It can read documents, understand context, execute multi-step workflows, and produce outputs in various formats. When demonstrated on legal contracts, it identified relevant clauses, flagged risks, and drafted responses faster than a junior associate.

This is impressive. It is not replacement.

The demonstration showed Cowork handling a standardized commercial lease. The lease followed templates. The risks were known categories. The workflow was linear. These are precisely the conditions under which language models excel.

What the demonstration did not show: negotiating a term sheet where interests genuinely conflict. Advising on a contract where the law is unsettled. Handling a document in a language the model wasn't trained on, with cultural context it cannot possess.

## The 80/20 Fallacy

The argument for disruption goes like this: if AI can handle 80% of legal work, law firms will need fewer lawyers. If it can handle 80% of sales ops, Salesforce becomes less valuable.

This argument contains a hidden assumption that the 80% is fungible with the 20%.

It is not.

The 80% exists because humans standardized it. Template contracts exist because lawyers decided certain terms weren't worth negotiating. CRM workflows exist because sales processes were codified after thousands of iterations. The automation layer was already coming before LLMs.

The 20% is where value concentrates. The unusual deal structure. The client relationship that survives a pricing dispute. The judgment call on which compliance risk to escalate. AI systems remain remarkably poor at this kind of contextual reasoning.

A junior lawyer spending 80% of their time on document review is doing grunt work until they develop judgment. Automating the grunt work removes the training ground. The profession has to solve this, but it's a labor market problem, not a SaaS disruption story.

## Why Software Stocks Specifically?

The market sell-off targeted software companies that sell to enterprises. The logic: if AI can do what the software does, enterprises won't pay for the software.

This misunderstands what enterprises are buying.

When Salesforce sells a CRM, the customer is buying a system of record, integration with their existing stack, compliance certifications, service level agreements, and a support team they can call at 2am when the integration breaks.

When HubSpot sells marketing automation, the customer is buying templated best practices, a community of users, and the ability to hire from a pool of certified operators.

AI can assist with the tasks these tools enable. AI cannot replicate the institutional infrastructure surrounding them. At least not in the 12-month timeframe that current valuations imply.

## The Actual Threat

None of this means AI is irrelevant to software markets. The threat is real, but mislocated.

The companies most vulnerable are those selling point solutions for narrow tasks that AI handles well. Document extraction. Basic summarization. Simple classification. If your entire product is "we turn unstructured data into structured data," you have a problem.

The companies least vulnerable are platforms. Deep integrations are defensive moats. Compliance certifications take years to acquire. Ecosystem effects create switching costs that AI capabilities don't eliminate.

The market is pricing in category-level disruption when the actual dynamic is feature absorption. Salesforce will add AI features. HubSpot will add AI features. The tools become more valuable, not less.

## What Happens Next

Anthropic will iterate on Cowork. Demonstrations will get more impressive. More analysts will write notes predicting the death of SaaS.

Meanwhile, enterprises will run pilots. The pilots will reveal edge cases. The edge cases will require human judgment. The procurement cycle will drag on because enterprise software purchases always drag on.

In 18 months, we'll look back at this week's sell-off as a buying opportunity. Not because AI won't transform knowledge work, but because the transformation is measured in decades, not quarters.

The market is not always efficient. This week, it was wrong.
