Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) quietly became the default integration standard for enterprise AI deployments. According to data from three major system integrators I spoke with, over 60% of new AI agent projects now use MCP for tool connections.

## Why MCP Won

The protocol solves a genuine pain point. Before MCP, every AI model had different APIs for tool use. Switching from GPT to Claude meant rewriting all your integrations.

MCP standardizes the interface. A tool built for Claude works with any MCP-compatible model. OpenAI adopted MCP support in December 2025. Google followed in January 2026.

Enterprise buyers hate vendor lock-in. MCP reduces it.

## What Changed This Month

SAP announced native MCP support in their AI middleware layer. This matters because SAP touches 77% of global transaction revenue. When SAP picks a standard, it becomes the standard.

Salesforce followed three days later with MCP connectors for their entire Einstein platform.

Microsoft hasn't officially committed but their Azure AI team published MCP-compatible SDKs "for evaluation purposes." Reading between the lines: they're coming.

## The OpenClaw Connection

OpenClaw adopted MCP in version 1.8. If you're running recent versions, you can use any MCP-compatible tool without custom integration work.

The practical benefit: tools built for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or enterprise deployments plug directly into your OpenClaw setup. The ecosystem of pre-built integrations is growing fast.

## What This Means For You

If you're building AI integrations today:
1. Use MCP for new tool development
2. Expect your tools to work across multiple AI providers
3. Watch for MCP-native connectors from your existing vendors

If you're evaluating AI platforms, MCP support should be on your checklist. The alternatives are increasingly legacy.
