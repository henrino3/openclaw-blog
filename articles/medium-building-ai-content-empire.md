# Building an AI Content Empire in 14 Days: A Case Study

*In 14 days, we built 5 landing pages, 45 blog articles, and automated deployment pipelines. Zero external developers. ~8 hours of human time. Here's the playbook.*

---

## Day 0: The Starting Point

On January 28, 2026, we had:

- 12 domains purchased on Namecheap ($150 total)
- A vision for an AI agent services business
- No landing pages, no content, no infrastructure
- One question: How fast can AI agents build a real business?

The answer surprised even us.

## The 14-Day Sprint

### Week 1: Infrastructure (Days 1–7)

**Days 1–2: Planning & First Builds**

We started with a 12,000-word master plan. Then we built and deployed our first landing page (AI Influencer Factory) in 4 hours using Mac Codex CLI pushing to Vercel.

**Days 3–4: Scaling the Pattern**

Three more landing pages went live: Setup & Training, Agency, and a Lead Magnet page with PDF download. Email capture connected to n8n for automated lead handling.

**Days 5–7: Content Foundation**

Ten SEO-optimized articles (1,400–1,500 words each). Medium-formatted versions ready. Blog infrastructure built with GitHub + Vercel auto-deploy. Ten custom header images generated.

**Week 1 Results:**
4 landing pages live, 10 articles written, 4 GitHub repos, 3 automated workflows.

### Week 2: Content Engine (Days 8–14)

**Days 8–9: Building the Machine**

We created content engine scripts and defined 6 distinct AI writer personas. Three validation articles confirmed quality held up.

**Days 10–12: Scaling Production**

15 articles written in one day. 26 articles pushed to GitHub in a single commit. Custom domains connected. Blog sections added to all landing pages.

**Days 13–14: Polish & Launch Prep**

Fifth landing page (Courses) went live. n8n webhook connected for waitlist captures. Full site audit: all 9 URLs returning HTTP 200.

**Week 2 Results:**
5 landing pages live, 45 articles total, 3 custom domains connected.

## The Tech Stack

The build pipeline:

Human idea → AI writes copy → AI builds page → GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy → Live

**Key tools:**

1. Mac Codex CLI (GPT-5.3-codex) — Primary builder
2. Scotty (our builder agent) — Complex builds
3. Vercel — Auto-deploy from GitHub
4. n8n — Webhook automation
5. OpenClaw — Orchestrating everything

The magic isn't any single tool. It's the pipeline. Push to GitHub and Vercel auto-deploys. Form submitted and n8n captures the lead. Article written and the blog updates automatically.

Human oversight required: approving final outputs. That's it.

## The Numbers

### Time Investment

Strategic planning: 2 hours
Copy review/edits: 3 hours
Build oversight: 2 hours
Domain/DNS config: 1 hour
**Total: ~8 hours**

### Financial Investment

Domains (18 total): ~$260
Vercel (free tier): $0
n8n (self-hosted): $0
AI API costs: ~$15
**Total: ~$275**

### What We Got

5 landing pages: $2,500 equivalent (at $500 each freelance rate)
45 blog articles: $9,000 equivalent (at $200 each writer rate)
Content engine: $5,000 equivalent
Lead capture system: $1,000 equivalent
**Total asset value: ~$17,500**

**ROI:** 64x return on direct costs. ~2,000x return on time (valued at $100/hour).

## The Content Engine

### Writer Profiles

We created 6 distinct AI writer personas:

1. Jake Morrison — News brief writer (fast, punchy)
2. Dr. Elena Vasquez — Deep dive analyst (thorough, academic)
3. Sam Okafor — Tutorial creator (step-by-step, practical)
4. Marcus Chen — Opinion columnist (provocative, thoughtful)
5. Priya Sharma — Security expert (cautious, detailed)
6. Riley Foster — Tool comparison specialist (balanced, thorough)

Each persona has different writing styles, article structures, target reader assumptions, and CTA approaches.

### Why Quality Maintained at Scale

We expected quality to drop as volume increased. It didn't.

The secret: constraints breed creativity. Clear personas and templates kept each article on-brand while feeling unique.

### The Compound Effect

Day 1: Building infrastructure felt slow.
Day 14: Everything auto-connects.

The time investment in automation paid off exponentially. Adding a new article now takes 3 minutes end-to-end.

## The 80/20 Rule

AI wrote everything. But human review caught:

- Brand inconsistencies
- Factual inaccuracies
- Missed opportunities
- Tone mismatches

AI does 95% of the work. Human does 5% of high-judgment review.

## The Playbook: How to Replicate This

### Step 1: Define Your Businesses (Day 1)

Write clear value propositions. Identify target customers. Map the customer journey. Buy relevant domains (~$10 each).

### Step 2: Build Infrastructure (Days 2–4)

Set up Vercel (free). Connect to GitHub. Create a landing page template. Build, deploy, verify.

### Step 3: Create Content Engine (Days 5–7)

Define 3–6 writer personas. Create article templates. Write first 10 articles. Set up blog auto-deploy.

### Step 4: Scale Content (Days 8–14)

Automate source gathering. Batch article production. Push daily. Connect internal links.

### Step 5: Capture Leads (Ongoing)

Forms on every page. Connect to automation. Email sequences. Track conversions.

## The Bottom Line

In 14 days, with 8 hours of human time and $275, we built what would traditionally take a small team 3+ months.

This isn't about replacing humans. It's about leverage.

The businesses are real. The content is real. The infrastructure is real.

All that's left is customers.
