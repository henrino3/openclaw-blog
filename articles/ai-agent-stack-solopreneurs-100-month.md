# The AI Agent Stack for Solopreneurs Under $100/Month

*By Sam Okafor | February 14, 2026*

You don't need enterprise budgets to run AI agents effectively. I've been helping solopreneurs set up agent systems that cost less than their Netflix + Spotify + coffee subscriptions combined.

Here's the complete stack I recommend for anyone running a one-person business who wants AI agents handling their busywork.

## The Philosophy: Ruthless Prioritization

Before we get to tools, understand this: as a solopreneur, you can't automate everything. You have to pick the tasks that:

1. Happen repeatedly (at least weekly)
2. Don't require your unique judgment
3. Would cost more in time than dollars to keep doing manually

With ~$100/month, you can automate 3-4 core workflows. Choose wisely.

## The Stack: Under $100/Month

### Core Platform: OpenClaw ($0-29/month)
**Cost:** Free tier or $29/month for Pro

This is your agent runtime—where workflows live and execute. OpenClaw handles:
- Agent orchestration
- Multi-step workflows
- Integrations with your tools
- Scheduling and triggers

The free tier handles most solopreneur needs. Upgrade when you hit execution limits.

### AI Backbone: OpenAI or Anthropic ($20-40/month)
**Cost:** Pay-as-you-go, typically $20-40/month

You need an AI model to power your agents. For most text-based tasks:
- OpenAI's GPT-4o: $0.01-0.03 per 1K tokens (cheap for text work)
- Anthropic Claude 3.5: Similar pricing, better for longer documents

Budget $20-40/month for typical solopreneur usage (email handling, content drafts, data processing).

### Email: Gmail + Custom Domain ($6/month)
**Cost:** $6/month for Google Workspace Starter

Your AI agents need email access. Google Workspace gives you:
- Custom domain email (looks professional)
- API access for agent integration
- 30GB storage

### Automation Glue: n8n Cloud ($20/month)
**Cost:** $20/month Starter plan

When you need to connect tools that don't integrate directly:
- Webhooks for any API
- Scheduled triggers
- Multi-step workflows
- 5,000 executions/month

Most solopreneurs never hit the execution limit.

### Total Core Stack: ~$75/month

That leaves headroom for specialized tools:

## Add-On Tools (Pick Your Priority)

### Option A: Content Creation Focus
**Add:** Eleven Labs ($5/month) + Canva Pro ($13/month) = $18/month

- AI voice for video content
- Design templates for social media
- Total: $93/month

### Option B: Customer Management Focus
**Add:** Notion ($8/month) + Cal.com ($12/month) = $20/month

- CRM in Notion (AI agent manages)
- Automated scheduling
- Total: $95/month

### Option C: Research Focus
**Add:** Brave Search API ($5/month) + Perplexity Pro ($20/month) = $25/month

- Programmatic web search
- AI-powered research summaries
- Total: $100/month

## The Four Workflows That Matter

With your sub-$100 stack, here's what to automate first:

### 1. Inbox Triage (Saves: 5+ hours/week)

**What it does:**
- Reads all incoming email
- Categorizes: Urgent / Important / FYI / Spam
- Drafts responses for common patterns
- Summarizes action items daily

**Why first:** Email is the biggest time sink. Automating 70% of it changes your life.

### 2. Content Repurposing (Saves: 3+ hours/week)

**What it does:**
- Takes one piece of content (blog post, video script)
- Creates 5-10 social media variations
- Formats for each platform
- Queues for posting

**Why important:** Content is how solopreneurs grow. More content from same effort = faster growth.

### 3. Lead Qualification (Saves: 2+ hours/week)

**What it does:**
- Captures form submissions / inquiry emails
- Researches the prospect (company, role, size)
- Scores fit with your services
- Drafts personalized follow-up

**Why valuable:** Only spend time on leads that match. Let AI filter the noise.

### 4. Weekly Review Generator (Saves: 1+ hour/week)

**What it does:**
- Aggregates activity from all tools
- Summarizes what you worked on
- Calculates time allocation
- Suggests focus for next week

**Why underrated:** Solopreneurs lose track of priorities. Weekly clarity prevents drift.

## The Setup Sequence

Don't try to build all four workflows at once. Here's the order:

**Week 1:** Email Triage
- Connect Gmail to OpenClaw
- Set up categorization rules
- Test with your last 50 emails

**Week 2:** Content Repurposing
- Pick your primary content type
- Create templates for each platform
- Run first batch through the agent

**Week 3:** Lead Qualification
- Define your ideal customer criteria
- Set up enrichment (LinkedIn, company data)
- Create scoring rubric

**Week 4:** Weekly Review
- Connect your time tracking
- Define key metrics
- Schedule Friday automated report

## What NOT to Automate

Some things aren't worth the setup cost at solopreneur scale:

❌ **Customer support** — You probably don't have volume to justify it
❌ **Complex scheduling** — Cal.com is simpler than building an agent
❌ **Bookkeeping** — Use a proper tool like QuickBooks
❌ **Social media monitoring** — Manual is fine until you have real scale

The $100/month stack is for focused automation, not full-business autopilot.

## Scaling Up: When to Spend More

You've outgrown the $100 stack when:

1. **Execution limits** — Hitting n8n caps consistently
2. **Response time** — Need faster processing than API tier allows
3. **Complexity** — Workflows require enterprise integrations
4. **Volume** — 100+ emails/day, 50+ leads/week

At that point, you're probably making enough to justify $200-500/month. Cross that bridge when you reach it.

## The ROI Math

Let's be conservative:

**Time saved:** 10 hours/week
**Your hourly value:** $100 (low estimate for most solopreneurs)
**Monthly time savings:** 40 hours × $100 = $4,000

**Stack cost:** $100/month
**ROI:** 40x

Even if you only save 5 hours/week, you're looking at 20x ROI. The math works.

## Get Started Today

Here's your homework:

1. Sign up for OpenClaw (free tier)
2. Connect your Gmail
3. Build the inbox triage workflow
4. Run it for one week

If you save even 30 minutes that week, you'll be hooked. The rest of the stack follows naturally.

Solopreneurship is hard enough without doing busywork. Let the agents handle it.
